# Customer Satisfaction Prediction 🎯

This project analyzes customer support ticket data to predict satisfaction levels using machine learning models.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset CSV file.
- `plots/`: Stores all generated graphs.
- `models/`: Stores the trained Random Forest model (.pkl file).
- `customer_satisfaction_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the entire analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries to install.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or unzip the folder.
2. Install libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook: `customer_satisfaction_project.ipynb`
4. Run all cells step-by-step to train the model and see results.

## 🔍 Outcome
- Model saved as: `models/random_forest_model.pkl`
- Graphs saved in: `plots/`
